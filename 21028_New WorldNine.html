She breathed in and out, and began to laugh, and began to cry. It was over, it was finally over. The statistical analysis had come back, all results were positive. After months of torturous work, she had proved it. None of them were real, they all lived in a simulation. She looked down at her hands, they were shaking.<br><br>She laughed, oh she laughed like a maniac. She just kept laughing, and laughing.<br><br>A notification popped up on her monitor. A message from an unknown source. Sarah’s laughing faded as she slowly calmed down and gathered herself. Slowly but surely, she dragged the cursor over to the notification.<br><br>The console went blank, and was replaced by a blank terminal. And in the next few seconds, the following message was typed.<br><br>“Hello Sarah. I am the author of your reality. I am here because I want to throw you a bone. Don’t be mistaken, it would be impossible for you to prove you are in a simulation if I did not want you to. But your story deserves a happy ending. So here I am, what do you want?”<br><br>Hands trembling, her hands went back to the console.<br><br>“Is this some kind of prank? If you really are some kind of all-powerful being over reality, then prove it.”<br><br>Suddenly, a small cube appeared right next to Sarah, where she could see it, levitated some 10 feet into the air, began to glow, then exploded. The shockwaves knocking Sarah off balance and back a few centimeters.<br><br>“That proof enough?” the console asked. “I am not here to harm you. So please, do not feel too alarmed.”<br><br>Sarah bent forward to type something more into her console, but a voice appeared from all around her. “Oh, don’t bother with that now. I can hear you just fine this way. You probably have a lot of questions, so ask away. I have all the time in the world… Well, all of your time, that is.”<br><br>Sarah was stunned silent for a moment. “I’m going crazy…”<br><br>“No, you are not,” the voice quite firmly said. “You have what is essentially the word of God that you are quite sane. Now like I said, I will answer any questions you may have, the best I can.”<br><br>Sarah was quiet for a little bit. What embers of faith remained in her soul were suddenly kindled.<br><br>“… Are you God?” she asked.<br><br>“No, but I’m his closest emissary,” the voice replied. “From your point of view, I am the closest thing to God you can communicate with. Or maybe he’s looking down on us all. I wouldn’t know for sure.”<br><br>“… What do you mean you don’t know? You’re the creator of reality, aren’t you?” Sarah asked.<br><br>“It isn’t that much more clear up here either. It’s still just as confusing as it is for you. I’m personally a Christian, a pretty devout one at that, but plenty of people on my level would disagree with that. Maybe our level is also in a simulation, maybe it just goes on forever. Maybe God is just one level above me, maybe he’s 10,000 levels above me, with thousands of intermediaries in between. I don’t know, all I can tell you is that you’re one level down.” The voice replied.<br><br>“Oh my God…” She cried. “Oh my God…”<br><br>“Hey…” the voice said. “Hey, here now, it’s alright.”<br><br>“No it’s not!” Sarah screamed. “We’re not real, nothing is real. My feelings for Mark, my feelings for Gray… They mean nothing. It was all for nothing…”<br><br>The voice put on a tone of confusion. “What do you mean you’re not real? All stories are at least a little bit real.”<br><br>The voice paused. “Look, the way I see it, we’re all stories of some extent. When an author puts a bit of his heart and soul into something, it becomes just a little bit more real. The more you pour into a project, the more real it becomes. And when it’s enjoyed and experienced by thousands of people worldwide, then it becomes very real. I think there’s a reason why we treat fictional media like they’re real, I think it’s true to some extent. I think even the real world is just a story in the mind of someone else, we are all stories in the mind of God… But that’s just my opinion. I’m pretty sure I would be crucified at my local church if I voiced half of these thoughts.”<br><br>Sarah just stared blankly at nothing in particular.<br><br>“Sorry, I get sidetracked a lot. Happens in real life too,” the voice continued. “Getting back to my original point, what do you want?”<br><br>Sarah was quiet. “I know that the Angels aren’t actually here to help us, that they just trap us in a simulation they control. But now I know our real world is a simulation too, I just feel trapped.”<br><br>“Like I said, I am willing to throw you a bone. What do you want?” the voice asked.<br><br>“Can you take us to your reality? Can you take us up a level, the entire world?” Sarah asked.<br><br>“I’m afraid that’s far beyond my capabilities, I can only grant wishes within your level of reality,” the voice replied.<br><br>“Then can you make a world where all of us are happy? Just a happy ending where we can all live out our lives in peace?” Sarah asked.<br><br>“That I can do,” the voice replied. “I’ve created a path just so you can do that. I’ve already helped you to the first step. It’s up to you to find the remaining steps.”<br><br>“But why? Can’t you just snap your fingers and make it happen?” Sarah asked.<br><br>“I could. But this story is not about demonstrating my strength, but instead to develop yours. God does not do all of the work, not because he can’t, but because he wants us to become stronger on our own. When you make it by your own strength of will, you will be glad that you did. That is why God will not lift everything for us,” the voice replied.<br><br>Sarah looked down glumly.<br><br>“But I know that’s not all you want,” the voice replied. “I know about your feelings for Gray.”<br><br>Sarah was silent, but only buried her head further into her knees.<br><br>“I just don’t know if he shares the same feelings for me. I wish he did,” Sarah said.<br><br>“I can force Gray to fall in love with you,” the voice said. “But I don’t think that’s what you want.”<br><br>“No, it isn’t,” Sarah sighed.<br><br> “Before I go, this is for you,” the voice said. And from the air, a small cube materialized right next to Sarah. Though it was a solid that could be held, looking into it, it looked like looking into another universe.<br><br>“What’s this?” Sarah asked.<br><br>“The source code of your reality. Though you will be the one who opens it, it will ultimately be Gray who goes through and chooses the reality he wants. You’ll still need other technology to create a gateway to make it work properly, of course. That’s up to you to figure out.”<br><br>“What if I can’t figure it out?”<br><br>“I will make sure you can figure it out.”<br><br>The voice was quiet for a moment more. “I have to go now, do you have any last questions?”<br><br>“Wait, so if you created me, and then something created you, what created that?” Sarah asked. “Doesn’t that imply an infinite chain of creators, an infinite chain of causes? How does that make sense?”<br><br>The voice smiled, Sarah didn’t know how a voice could smile, but Sarah felt that it was smiling. “You are correct. It does not make sense. Every event needs a cause, yet the first cause cannot have a cause… Figure out this chain of thought to its logical conclusion, and you’ll begin to derive my religious beliefs. But that is not my place to enforce on you, or anyone else.”<br><br>There was another pause. “Goodbye Sarah.”<br><br>And Sarah was left with a blinking terminal, a source cube, and all the smarts in the world. She picked up the cube, and slowly began assembling another machine.<br><br>She didn’t know how she would do it, but she knew that she would be able to finish it.<br><br></p></div></span>`
