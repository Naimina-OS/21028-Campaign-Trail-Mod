Her parents are giants, Nobel-Prize winning researchers and professors.

But no matter what, she never seemed to be able to win over the working classes. So, she pivoted, going into the United Nations, trudging through war and medical triage to prove she could make a difference. She’s gone around the entire world to prove that she is not just a nepo baby. Deep down, she thinks she isn’t trying to convince the world, but trying to convince herself.",
